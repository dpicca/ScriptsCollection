# XML Translator Script

## Description

This script provides an efficient way to translate XML files using Google's translation service. It takes advantage of concurrent processing to speed up the translation of text nodes within the XML structure. The script is designed to handle large XML files by breaking texts into chunks and processing them in parallel.

Key features include:
- Command-line interface for flexibility.
- Rate-limiting to respect Google's translation service constraints.
- Concurrent processing for improved performance.
- Error handling to manage and report potential translation issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install deep_translator tqdm
```

### Usage

1. Download the script and make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x translate_script_with_io_args.py
```

2. Run the script with the necessary parameters:
```bash
./translate_script_with_io_args.py --source [SOURCE_LANG] --target [TARGET_LANG] --input [INPUT_FILENAME.xml] --output [OUTPUT_FILENAME.xml]
```
Replace `[SOURCE_LANG]`, `[TARGET_LANG]`, `[INPUT_FILENAME.xml]`, and `[OUTPUT_FILENAME.xml]` with your desired source language, target language, input XML filename, and output XML filename, respectively.

For example, to translate from English to French:
```bash
./translate_script_with_io_args.py --source en --target fr --input input.xml --output translated_output.xml
```

3. After execution, check the output file for the translated content. If there were any errors during translation, they will be printed to the console.

### Note

This script requires internet access to interact with Google's translation service. Ensure you are not behind a firewall or VPN that might block requests to external services.
